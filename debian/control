Description: terminal multiplexer
 tmux enables a number of terminals (or windows) to be accessed and 
 controlled from a single terminal like screen. tmux runs as a 
 server-client system.  A server is created automatically when 
 necessary and holds a number of sessions, each of which may have 
 a number of windows linked to it. Any number of clients may connect 
 to a session, or the server may be controlled by issuing commands 
 with tmux. Communication takes place through a socket, by default 
 placed in /var/run. Moreover tmux provides a consistent and 
 well-documented command interface, with the same syntax whether used 
 interactively, as a key binding, or from the shell. It offers a 
 choice of vim or emacs key layouts.
